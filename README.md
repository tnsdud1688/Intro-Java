# Intro-Java
Java Lab
At the beginning, I started Java with these instructions.
I had lots of differences labs for different cases.

first, intro Java is about the basic skills which are string, int, println, input, and startTime.
second, lab1 is about differences between print and println also, line comment, paragraph comment and document comment.
third, lab2 is about scanner, if-else function, multiple condition in one functioini, and break function.
